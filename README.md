# Next Chapter — web prototype

Hi! This is **Next Chapter**. Quick access to our demo: https://next-chapter-omega.vercel.app/

A runnable React + TypeScript + Vite recreation of the **Next Chapter** mobile app design
(Figma file *Next-Chapter*, page **“Page 4 Job Transition”**).

Next Chapter is an AI-powered career-transition companion for experienced people who have lost
their professional direction (laid off, retiring, ready for a change). The prototype follows
**Sarah, 48** — 20 years leading projects and teams in tech — as she rediscovers her strengths
with **Joyy**, the AI coach, chooses to explore yoga teaching, and turns it into a 100-day plan.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

Other scripts:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Type-checks and builds a static site into `dist/` (relative paths, works on GitHub Pages or any static host). |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the production build locally. |
| `npm run fetch:assets` | Downloads the photos from Figma into `public/images/` (see below). |

### Photos

The photos in the Figma file are not committed here. Every image slot renders a soft,
on-palette placeholder until the real file exists. To pull the originals from Figma:

```bash
FIGMA_TOKEN=<personal access token> npm run fetch:assets
```

Create the token in Figma → Settings → Security → *Personal access tokens* (read-only file
content is enough). The script maps each slot to its Figma node in `scripts/fetch-figma-assets.mjs`.

## Responsive behaviour

- **Desktop / tablet (≥ 600 px):** the app is shown inside a 390 × 844 iPhone frame with the
  Dynamic Island, status bar and home indicator — the same viewport as the Figma frames. On wide
  screens (≥ 1000 px) a *prototype map* on the left jumps to any screen or overlay.
- **Phones (< 600 px):** the prototype fills the real screen, drops the fake status bar / home
  indicator and uses the device safe-area insets instead.
- Each screen keeps the top bar and bottom tab bar fixed while the content scrolls, as in Figma.

## Screens and flow

| Route | Figma frame | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | P1 - Welcome Page | “Discover My Next Chapter” opens **Meet Joyy** |
| `/coach/start` | P2 - AI Coach Guiding | First-time chat, journey step 1, no tab bar |
| `/strengths` | P3 - User Strength | Journey step 2 |
| `/possibilities` | P4 | Journey step 3 — reached only from P3 and “Revisit My Possibilities” |
| `/fit` | P5 | “Build My 100-Day Yoga Plan” opens **Plan ready** |
| `/coach` | P2.2 - AI Coach | AI Coach tab |
| `/discover` | P4.2 - Discover Your Next Steps | Discover tab once a path is chosen |
| `/roadmap` | P6 - Roadmap | Long-term goal → milestones → next action |
| `/community` | P7 - Community | Peer circles, human guide, RSVP |
| `/community/my-day` | P7.2 - My Day | Schedule fed by Community, Discover and Roadmap |
| `/me` | User Page | Avatar in the top bar |
| `/messages` | P8 - Messages | 💬 in the top bar |
| `/joyy` | Joyy Settings | From the ≡ drawer or Joyy’s profile |

Overlays: settings drawer (≡ — text size, bold text and high contrast actually work), Meet Joyy,
Joyy profile, Plan ready, and three *Add to My Day* sheets (gathering RSVP, guide chat, trial class).

## Design system

- **Colour** — tokens mirror the Figma variable collection *Next Chapter · Color*
  (`src/styles/tokens.css`): Primary `#1E382B`, Secondary `#D9933B`, Tertiary `#995A4E`, Neutral `#232623`.
- **Type** — Newsreader for headlines, Atkinson Hyperlegible Next for body and labels (bundled via Fontsource).
- **Components** — top bar, bottom nav, journey steps, Joyy mascot/avatar, radar chart, pills, toggles and
  cards in `src/components/`.

## Project structure

```

  App.tsx              router, device frame, prototype map
  routes.ts            route ↔ Figma frame map
  context/             overlay + display-settings state
  components/          shared UI (Chrome, Screen, Joyy, RadarChart, Icon, ui…)
  overlays/            drawer, modals and bottom sheets
  screens/             one file per Figma frame
